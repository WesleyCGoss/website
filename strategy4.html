            <p>1 A strategic thinker is a <a href="human.html">great being</a>. A gift to bear lies in his left hand and a budern is upon his back, and his eyes see paths that only the gods have given to him. He is a vision giver. "Where there is no vision, the people perish."</p>
            <p>2 The greatest thinkers are those who have a firm, precise appraisal of their abilities, and they weild it with focused force.</p>
            <p>3 Distinguish yourself form other skills. The differences are subtle and pernicious. You are not a producer - you do not produce things from nothing; you are not a performer - you do not dazzle with your actions in real time; you are not a commander - you do not issue directions directly to others or manage them; you are not an advisor - you do not reveal a million details about a million objects; you are a <a href="wikiedia.org/humans">strategist</a> - you reorganize resources in the most beautiful and functional way and meet your goal.</p>
            <p>4 Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. </p>
            <p>  Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</p>
            <p>5 And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</p>
            <p> And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray then like this:</p>
            <p> “Our Father in heaven,<br>
            hallowed be your name.<br>
            Your kingdom come,<br>
            your will be done,<br>
            on earth as it is in heaven.<br>
            Give us this day our daily bread,<br>
            and forgive us our debts,<br>
            as we also have forgiven our debtors.<br>
            And lead us not into temptation,<br>
            but deliver us from evil."</p>
