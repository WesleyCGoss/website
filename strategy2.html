            <h2 class="opening"> THE ART OF STRATEGY </h2>
            <p class="opening"> Book 1 </p>
            <p> <strong>1</strong>&nbsp; A strategic thinker is a great being. A gift to bear lies in his left hand and a budern is upon his back, and his eyes see paths that only the gods have given to him. He is a vision giver. "Where there is no vision, the people perish."</p>

You are not a producer - you do not produce things from nothing; you are not a performer - you do not dazzle with your actions in real time; you are not a commander - you do not issue directions directly to others or manage them; you are not an advisor - you do not reveal a million details about a million objects; you are a strategist - you reorganize resources in the most beautiful and functional way and meet your goal.</p>

            <p> <strong>5</strong>&nbsp; them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth."
